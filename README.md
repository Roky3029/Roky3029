### Miguel - Web Developer

#### Hey! :)
<br>
I'm Miguel, a computer sciente student at the Universitat Politècnica de València. I'm currently focused on web development although I have not ruled out other areas. 
<br>
<br>

##### These are some of my webs that I made over time:
- [Adivina el elemento](https://adivinaelelemento.vercel.app)
  - A web all about chemistry and the periodic table. Get to know the different elements or test your knowledge by its quizes!
- [F1 Statistics](https://somebitsoff1.vercel.app)
    - A project that aimed to be the F1 Wiki, obtaining through an API all the data from the current season.
    (NOTE: This project now is not working due to the shutdown of the API, and because I did not find any suitable replacement API)


If, for any reason, you wish to contact me, you can write me to [this email](emailto:mikirb30@gmail.com)
