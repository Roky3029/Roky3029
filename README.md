### Miguel - Web Developer

#### Hey! :)
<br>
I'm Miguel, a computer sciente student at the Universitat Politècnica de València. I'm currently focused on web development although I have not ruled out other areas.

##### These are some of my webs that I made over time:
- [Numb3r](https://numb3r5.vercel.app)
  - My latest web. It is all about numbers and is the perfect app for students as it calculates all the basic operations a student will need. It has numerical apps, vectorial and matrix ones!
- [Adivina el elemento](https://adivinaelelemento.vercel.app)
  - A web all about chemistry and the periodic table. Get to know the different elements or test your knowledge by its quizes!
- [F1 Statistics](https://somebitsoff1.vercel.app)
    - A project that aimed to be the F1 Wiki, obtaining through an API all the data from the current season.
    (NOTE: This project now is not working due to the shutdown of the API, and because I did not find any suitable replacement API)


If, for any reason, you wish to contact me, you can write me to <code>mjibarb30@gmail.com</code>
