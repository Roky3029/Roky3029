### Miguel - Web Developer

#### Hey! I'm Miguel, a web developer from Spain. I have experience in several languages, such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript, TypeScript, React, NextJS, etc. My aim as a developer is to create products which people will use in their day-to-day. That's why my webs will be created with the objective of end up being totally functional and useful webs over time.

##### Here are some webs I've made:
- [Adivina el elemento](https://adivinaelelemento.vercel.app)
- [F1 Statistics](https://somebitsoff1.vercel.app)
- [Calculadora](https://mikidevcalculator.netlify.app)
